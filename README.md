# Markov_Chain_Graph
Graph Composer Based on Markov Chain Implementation

This project is a Python-based Graph Composer utilizing Markov chains to generate text compositions based on input text files. The application constructs a graph where each vertex represents a word, and edges between vertices denote transitions observed in the text. By analyzing these transitions, the program generates new sequences of words that mimic the statistical patterns observed in the original text.
